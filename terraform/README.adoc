= Angkor Infrastructure (Terraform)

====
This is the getting started readme for the *Angkor Terraform Module* in the `/infra` subfolder,
for general Information on the Project please refer to the readme in the Project root!
====


== Project Overview

Angkor Infra is a comprehensive cloud infrastructure deployment subproject using OpenTofu (Terraform fork) that provisions a complete AWS-based application stack with supporting services.

=== Core Infrastructure Components

**Compute & Networking**

* **EC2 Instance**: Main application server with Docker Compose, automated SSL via Certbot
* **VPC Integration**: Uses existing AWS VPC and subnet infrastructure
* **Route53 DNS**: Automated domain management with SSL certificate support
* **IAM Roles**: Instance profiles and deployment user for GitHub Actions

**Data & Storage**

* **S3 Buckets**: Production and development data storage with backup lifecycle
* **Database**: External PostgreSQL (NeonDB) integration
* **Messaging**: SNS/SQS for event-driven architecture (prod + dev queues)

**Authentication & Security**

* **AWS Cognito**: OAuth2/OIDC with Google and Facebook social login
* **Phase.dev**: Centralized secrets management for production, staging, and development
* **IAM Policies**: Least-privilege access controls

**Monitoring & Observability**

* **Grafana Cloud**: Monitoring and alerting integration
* **Confluent Kafka**: Event streaming with multiple topics (app.events, audit.events, system.events, dev.events)
* **Resource Groups**: Tag-based resource organization

=== Key Features

**Multi-Environment Support**

* Production and development resource separation
* Environment-specific secrets and configurations
* CI/CD staging environment integration

**DevOps Integration**

* GitHub Actions deployment user
* Automated Docker container updates
* API token management system
* SSH key management for EC2 access

**Modern Architecture**

* Event-driven microservices pattern
* Container-based deployment with Docker Compose
* Centralized configuration via SSM Parameters
* Tag-based resource management

=== Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: AWS profile, terraform.tfvars, terraform-backend.tf (unversioned)

**Commands** (via Makefile):

[source,bash]
----
make init     # Initialize OpenTofu
make plan     # Validate and show execution plan
make apply    # Deploy infrastructure
make fmt      # Format configuration
make output   # Display deployment outputs
----

**Management Tasks**:

* `make ec2-start/stop/status` - Instance control
* `make ssh/ps/deploy` - Remote operations
* `make release` - Release management

=== Technology Stack

* **Infrastructure**: OpenTofu ~> 1.3, AWS Provider ~> 5.13
* **Compute**: EC2, Docker Compose
* **Authentication**: AWS Cognito
* **Messaging**: Confluent Kafka, SNS/SQS
* **Storage**: S3, PostgreSQL
* **Secrets**: Phase.dev
* **Monitoring**: Grafana Cloud
* **DNS**: Route53, Certbot

=== Modular Design

The project uses a clean modular architecture with 20+ reusable modules in `/modules/`, each following consistent patterns (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, versions.tf). Resources follow `{appid}-{type}-{descriptor}` naming convention with comprehensive tagging strategy.


== Tips & Tricks

=== Preparation

Copy the templates for terraform backend configuration and terraform variables and
set values according to your news.

WARNING: Both files must *not* be placed under version control

----
cp terraform-backend.tf.tmpl
cp terraform.tfvars.tmpl terraform.tfvars
----

----
$ tfswitch
Reading file .terraform-version
Switched terraform to version "0.14.9"

$ terraform init
Initializing modules...
(...)
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
----

Create `release.auto.tfvars` (which should not be versioned either) to store the current release
----
$ echo -n 'release = "v0.11.0"' > release.auto.tfvars
----

=== Build

* Make sure `AWS_PROFILE` is set and points to a valid config in your `~/.aws` dir
* Run `make` without args to see all supported targets (which mostly delegate to Terraform CLI)

----
$ make
apply                          terraform apply --auto-approve (applies without prompting)
check                          terraform fmt -check (Check if input is formatted, return != 0 if not)
deploy                         alias for target 'apply'
fmt                            runs terraform fmt (Reformat your configuration in the standard style)
init                           runs terraform init (Prepare your working directory for other commands)
plan                           runs terraform plan (includes targets fmt and validate)
release                        manage release info based on latest git tag and release.auto.tfvars
tfswitch                       runs tfswitch if the binary exists and .terraform-version is present
----

=== Migrate

  3:   tags = map("terraformModule", "release")
│
│ Call to function "map" failed: the "map" function was deprecated in Terraform v0.12 and is no longer available; use tomap({ ... }) syntax to write a literal map.


=== Useful Tools
----
$ brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch
tfswitch 0.12.1092 is already installed

$ tfswitch
Reading file .terraform-version
Switched terraform to version "0.14.9"
