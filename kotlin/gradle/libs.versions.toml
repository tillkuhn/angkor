# "We can replace these plugin references with version catalog defined values. First we must create the file
# gradle/libs.version.toml in our project directory. We might already have such file with definitions for the
# dependencies we use in our build and tests.
# Next we must add a section [plugins] where we can define our plugin dependencies.
# We can use the full power of the version catalog here, the only thing we need to remember is to use the
# id property of we use the longer notation option. With the shorthand notation we can simply define a string value
# with the id of the plugin, a colon : and the version."
#
# You can use separators such as -, _, . that will be normalized
# by Gradle to . in the catalog and allow you to create subsections.

[versions]
# Versions is used to declare the version numbers that will be referenced later by plugins and libraries.
# can be used as version.ref in [plugins] and [libraries] section, see flyway-core example below
archunit = "0.23.1"
flyway = "10.4.1"
jacoco = "0.8.11"  # used like "toolVersion = libs.versions.jacoco.get()" in jacoco block
kotlin = "1.9.22"
mockito = "4.11.0"
postgresql = "42.7.1"
rome = "1.19.0"
spring-boot = "3.2.0"
wiremock = "3.0.1"

[plugins]
# Plugins were added in Gradle 7.2, are used (obviouly) to define plugins.
# use like "alias(libs.plugins.spring.boot)" in build.gradle.kts plugins section

# We can use shorthand notation with the plugin id and version.
versions = "com.github.ben-manes.versions:0.50.0"

# Or we can use the longer notation option where we set the id and version for the plugin.
flyway-plugin = { id = "org.flywaydb.flyway", version.ref = "flyway" }
spring-boot = { id = "org.springframework.boot", version.ref = "spring-boot" }  # 3.1.5

sonarqube = { id = "org.sonarqube", version = "4.4.1.3373" } # new  "4.3.1.3277" -> 4.4.1.3373"

# Here we use the longer notation and version.ref to reference an entry from the [versions] section.

[libraries]
# Define the libraries that will be later accessed in our Gradle files.
# use like "implementation(libs.flyway.core)" in build.gradle.kts dependencies section
# replace hyphens in name with dots: flyway-core -> flyway.core
