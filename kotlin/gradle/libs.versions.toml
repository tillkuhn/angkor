# "We can replace these plugin references with version catalog defined values. First we must create the file
# gradle/libs.version.toml in our project directory. We might already have such file with definitions for the
# dependencies we use in our build and tests. Next we must add a section [plugins] where we can define our plugin
# dependencies. We can use the full power of the version catalog here, the only thing we need to remember is to use the
# id property of we use the longer notation option. With the shorthand notation we can simply define a string value
# with the id of the plugin, a colon (:) and the version."
#
#  You can use separators such as -, _, . that will be normalized
# by Gradle to . in the catalog and allow you to create subsections.
# File: gradle/libs.versions.toml


# versions is used to declare the version numbers that will be referenced later by plugins and libraries.
[versions]
# Define version we can use as version.ref in [plugins] and [libraries], see flyway-core example below
# CAUTION: 9.22.3 leads to Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major v 63 (Java 19)
flyway = "9.21.1"
postgresql="42.7.1"

# plugins Were added in Gradle 7.2, are used (obviouly) to define plugins.
[plugins]
# We can use shorthand notation with the plugin id and version.
# use like "alias(libs.plugins.spring.boot)" in  build.gradle.kts plugins section
spring-boot = "org.springframework.boot:3.2.1"

# We can use the longer notation option where we set
# the id and version for the plugin.
spring-dep-mgmt = { id = "io.spring.dependency-management", version = "1.1.3" }

# Here we use the longer notation and version.ref to reference
# the version defined in the [versions] section.
flyway-plugin = { id = "org.flywaydb.flyway", version.ref = "flyway" }

# Define the libraries that will be later accessed in our Gradle files.
# use like   "implementation(libs.flyway.core)" in build.gradle.kts dependencies section
[libraries]
flyway-core = { module = "org.flywaydb:flyway-core", version.ref = "flyway" }
postgresql = { module = "org.postgresql:postgresql", version.ref = "postgresql" }

# bundles? maybe coming soon. maybe not
