// This class is included by various *.ts files for shared css code
// that doesn't work in the global style.scss sheet, only in component scss files

// e.g. this should work but doesn't: https://material.angular.io/guide/elevation, related discussion:
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56609472/why-can-i-only-set-mat-elevation-settings-at-the-component-level-css

// Alternative to this OR https://stackoverflow.com/a/56978906/4292075 turn of encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
@use '~@angular/material' as mat;
@import 'node_modules/@angular/material/theming';
.app-card {
  @include mat.elevation(18);
}

// Card images should not exceed 400px
img.mat-card-image {
  max-height: 400px;
}

// make sure your component .ts used encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None or this won't work

// ATTENTION: This also influences the menu on the lef hand side (no padding)
// SO We disable it for the time being, even though the list items now occopy more space e.g. in notes overview

//.mat-list-base .mat-list-item .mat-list-item-content {
//  padding: 0px !important
//}
