= Build Locally

== IntelliJ IDEA Considerations

=== Hot Code Replace + Performance

Not sure if all of this is necessary, but the following mix works for me:
According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6402162/how-to-enable-intellij-hot-code-swap[How to enable Intellij hot code swap]

* IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Compiler [x] Make/Build project Automatically
* Help -> Find Action -> Registry [x] `compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running`
* Edit Configuration -> Spring Boot -> On Update Action / On Frame Deactivation select "Update Classes and Resources" for both
* Use Debug mode or hot code replace won't work
* Don't enable launch optimzation (shows error with JDK 14 b/c of -noverify switch)
but add only `-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1` as VM Option
* Disable JMX Agent. User JRE 14 (~/sdkman/candidates/java/14.0.2-zulu/zulu-14.jdk/Contents/Home)

=== JDK 14 and Gradle Version Issues

[source,shell script]
----
$ sdk install java 14.0.2-zulu # installs to ~/.sdkman/candidates/java/14.0.2-zulu
$ sdk install gradle 6.5
----

* Remove "Enable Launch Optimization" to supress following warning "OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Options -Xverify:none and -noverify were deprecated in JDK 13 and will likely be removed in a future release."

* IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle
** use "specified location" e.g. `~/.sdkman/candidates/gradle/6.5`
** use same Gradle JVM e.g. 11.0.7 as in "Project Structure -> Platform Settings -> SDKs"
** Project Structure -> Platform Settings -> SDKs e.g. `~.sdkman/candidates/java/14.0.2-zulu/zulu-14.jdk/Contents/Home` (recommended use of https://sdkman.io/[sdkman])
which should resolve to the same JDK as your shell's `$JAVA_HOME` var
