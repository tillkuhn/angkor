=== Github Actions

'''
.Checklist
* [x] api Gradle Build with Docker Push
* [x] ui Angular Build with Docker Push
* [x] docs Antora build
* [x] docs Deploy to S3 Bucket
* [ ] for all modules: trigger redeploy on new build


IMPORTANT: There is a lot to do!

== Post Action Webhook

https://github.com/marketplace/actions/workflow-webhook-action[Workflow Webhook Action]
A Github workflow action to call (POST) a remote webhook endpoint with a json payload

[source,yaml]
----
  - name: Invoke deployment hook
    uses: distributhor/workflow-webhook@v1
    env:
      webhook_url: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_URL }}
      webhook_secret: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_SECRET }}
      data: '{ "module": "api", "drink" : "milk" }'
----

Tip: The hash signature is identical to that which a regular Github webhook would generate, and sent in a header field named `X-Hub-Signature`.

== Angkor Development CLI

The entire project uses https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html[GNU Make] on top level to manage the various ecosystems for our different modules.
The *Makefile* documents itself when `make` is called without arguments (inspired by https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html[Self-Documented Makefile])
