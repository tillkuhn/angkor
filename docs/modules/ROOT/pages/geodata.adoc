== Geographical hierarchy

The project basically follows the https://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel:Geographical_hierarchy[Wikitravel Geographical Hierarchy]
approach of organizing geopgraphical units:

* The Earth contains
** https://wikitravel.org/shared/Category:Continents[Continents], which contain...
*** Continental sections such as SE-Asia + Scandinavia, which contain...
**** Countries (refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2[official ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code of a country]), which contain...
***** Regions (we stop here)

* To store the hirarchy in a flat table and build a tree from it check https://www.java-success.com/00-%E2%99%A6-creating-tree-list-flattening-back-list-java/[00: Creating a Tree from a list & flattening it back to a list in Java]
* For UI Visualization in Angular use https://material.angular.io/components/tree/examples[ mat-tree provides a Material Design styled tree that can be used to display hierarchy data.]

== Lat, Lon, GeoJSON

* Bangkok Latitude is `13.736717` and longitude is `100.523186.`
* Google notation would be `@13.7244416,100.3529157`  **(Lat, Lon)!!!**
* GeoJSON position coordinates would be ``  **(Lon,Lat)!!!**

[quote,rfc7946 GeoJSON Point, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2,]
A position is an array of numbers.  There MUST be two or more
elements.  The first two elements are longitude and latitude, or
easting and northing, precisely in that order and using decimal
numbers.  Altitude or elevation MAY be included as an optional third
element.

== Examples and RegEx for goole maps URLs

Finding the correct RegEx expression for your map's URL:
https://help.parsehub.com/hc/en-us/articles/226061627-Scrape-latitude-and-longitude-data-from-a-Google-Maps-link[Scrape latitude and longitude data from a Google Maps link]

Google format is **LAT**itude followed by **LON**ngitude and Z (altitude? data grid? we don't know and don't need)
Examples:
```
@41.25907,13.4254605,15z  Sperlonga
@-0.9175391,9.2298915,7z Gabun Ã„quator
@1.3143394,103.7041653,11z Singapur
```

If the latitude and longitude in the URL is preceded by an "@" symbol, e.g. https://www.google.ca/maps/@43.6474528,-79.3799409,14.78z):

.RegEx for Google Notation
|===
|**Type** |**RegEx**
|Latitude
|`\@(-?[\d\.]*)`
|Longitude
|`\@[-?\d\.]*\,([-?\d\.]*)`
