----
git branch --merged| grep -v master | xargs git branch -d
----

.fine grained interaction

git branch -d arm64
warning: not deleting branch 'arm64' that is not yet merged to
'refs/remotes/origin/arm64'

git branch -r    # list remotes
git push --delete origin arm64
git branch -d arm64
# or without deleting the remote:

----
git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD
git config --global alias.puma '! git checkout master && git pull'
git config --list | grep alias  # show
